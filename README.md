# LlamaCompass - Llama powered MultiAgent Performance and Security Analysis Platform

## Problem Statement
### Problem 1: Security & Compliance Gap in Code Generation Tools
Current AI code generation tools (like Cursor, GitHub Copilot) operate without awareness of organization-specific security policies, compliance frameworks, or architectural standards. This creates a critical gap where:

Generated code may violate company security requirements (data handling, authentication patterns, API usage)
Compliance violations go undetected until manual review (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS standards)
Developers must manually verify every suggestion against internal guidelines
Security debt accumulates as non-compliant patterns proliferate across codebases

Core Issue: AI tools lack contextual understanding of enterprise constraints, making them productivity aids rather than trusted development partners.

### Problem 2: Multiagent System Observability and Debugging Crisis
Multiagent systems suffer from fundamental analysis and debugging challenges that make production deployment risky:

Runtime Opacity: Failures cascade through agent interactions with unclear root causes
Orchestration Complexity: Agent coordination failures are difficult to trace and reproduce
State Management: Distributed state across agents makes system behavior unpredictable
Error Attribution: Determining which agent or interaction caused system failure is nearly impossible

Core Issue: The emergent complexity of agent interactions creates a "black box" effect where system behavior becomes unanalyzable and unreliable at scale.
